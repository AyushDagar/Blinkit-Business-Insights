# Blinkit Sales Dashboard (Excel Project)

Welcome to my Blinkit Sales Analysis & Dashboard project! This is one of the most enjoyable and insightful Excel dashboards I've built, and I’m excited to share it with you.

This project started as a simple dataset exploration, but as I dug deeper, I realized how much business intelligence can actually be extracted from everyday retail data. From understanding how outlet size influences revenue to discovering which product categories truly drive sales—this dashboard captures it all.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to transform raw Blinkit sales data into a clean, interactive, and visually intuitive dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard allows users to:
- Track **Total Sales**, **Average Sales**, **Number of Items**, and **Average Rating**
- Compare outlet performance by **Size**, **Location**, and **Establishment Year**
- Analyze product behavior based on **Item Type**, **Fat Content**, and **Category**
- Explore trends and insights using slicers and dynamic filters

Everything from data cleaning to visualization was done inside Excel using pivot tables, charts, lookup sheets, and custom formatting.

## 🛠️ What I Built

### ✔ 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Standardized categories such as *Fat Content* → "Low Fat" / "Regular"
- Mapped item types into broader categories via a **LOOKUPS** sheet
- Created well-structured pivot tables for KPIs and visual insights
- Ensured consistent numeric formats (Sales, Ratings, MRP)

### ✔ 2. Pivot Tables
I created multiple pivot tables that form the backbone of the dashboard:
- **KPI Pivot:** Total Sales, Avg Sales, Avg Rating by Outlet Size
- **Sales by Fat Content** (donut chart)
- **Sales by Item Type** (horizontal bar chart)
- **Fat-by-Outlet** (stacked bar)
- **Sales by Establishment Year** (area chart)
- **Sales by Outlet Size** (pie chart)
- **Sales by Outlet Location** (bar chart)

### ✔ 3. Dashboard Inputs
To make the dashboard interactive:
- Added dropdowns for **Product Category**, **Outlet Size**, and **Rating Bucket**
- Used data validation and linked LOOKUP lists

### ✔ 4. Dashboard Design
Focused heavily on:
- Clean layout  
- Readable typography  
- Meaningful color palette  
- Consistent card-style KPI visuals  
- Smooth charts that tell a story instantly  

The final dashboard is designed to feel intuitive, modern, and enjoyable to explore.

## 📊 Key Insights from the Data
A few interesting insights the dashboard reveals:
- **Regular-fat products generate more revenue** than low-fat items  
- **Tier 2 outlets dominate sales**, outperforming Tier 1 and Tier 3 combined  
- **High outlet size locations show the strongest revenue figures**  
- Product categories like *Snack Foods* and *Fruits & Vegetables* significantly outperform others  

Each chart and pivot table contributes to building a clear narrative around Blinkit's performance.
